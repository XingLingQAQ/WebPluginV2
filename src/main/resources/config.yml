  ServerIP: localhost
  ServerIPComment: Used for both PHP and HTML in the command /webp (only spigot/bukkit and such NOT Proxy) WebPlugin binds webservers to the 0.0.0.0 (servers ip)

  debug: false
  debugcomment: Only enable if I need debug logs or if you can figure out debug info yourself. This will NOT make a debug.log file it will post in console.

  EnablePHP: false
  PHPComment: If you use linux a fair warning here! WebPlugin WILL download a file from its distro on github (see bellow) this file is a precompiled version of php 8.2 for linux. If you don't agree with this download please don't enable!
  GithubWebPluginPHPRepo: https://github.com/hypersmc/WebPluginV2Repo
  GithubWebPluginPHPRepoFilename: WebPlugin-linux-PHP8.2-PRECOMPILED.tar.gz
  GithubWebPluginComment: If this file name doesn't match the one downloaded then I either forgot to update this or something happened on the repo. Report it to me on discord :)

  EnableHTML: true
  HTMLComment: If you have PHP enabled you don't need html enabled as PHP can also handle HTML code.

  Autokey: false
  AutoKeyComment: Don't enable as it's still WIP.
